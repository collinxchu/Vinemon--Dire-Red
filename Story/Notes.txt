Dem is a shitty trainer with really bad pokemon and like one overpowered one, and the team rocket part consisting with a bunch of jabronis and homobutts trying to convert everyone in kanto to the darkholme religion.

KY's town is North Korea, poison gym.

Male beginning is basement-dweller being kicked out to become a pokemon master.

Female is chasing her dreams of being a pokemon master.

StudyGuy's city as North Korea.
Direboar's as really shitty because jokes.
